      Module 2 Summary:
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      The internet as we know it today, is a collection of computers that are connected to eachother across the globe, forming the current web; and the internet uses different tools such as encryption and decryption
      There are many aspects of the internet that run the web, such as encryption and decryption:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption: uses different ecryption algorithms such as RSA</li>
      <li>Decryption: decrypts the message or file sent into readable text</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
      How does the internet work? (expanded)
    </h1>
    
    
    <h4>
      Networks [&] protocols
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>When surfing the internet, your data usually goes through a ISP (Internet Service Provider)!</li>
      <li>ISPs then send your request to differnet servers and those servers get back to you</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p>
      Protocols are how data is transmitted and received between devices, and they include but are not limited to: HTTPS, TCP/IP and many more
      they work by one device that sends a request using a protocol such as HTTPS for a website, and the data is broken into packets, which is recieved by the second device. 
      Physical connections also play a big part in the internet, such as fiber optic cables, and underground internet cables, which link continents together online. they are
      a vital part of the internet, as if we didn't have them, we wouldn't have any internet.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      Packet switching [&] Routing
    </h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Packet switching: Data broken into smaller packets, sent and reassembled</li>
      <li>Routing: the best path for these packets to travel</li>
      <li>Reliability: makes sure that all data is recieved, if not, they are reordered</li>
    </ul>

      What is Encoding?
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another, mainly for processing, storage or transmission.
      there are many ways of encoding such as:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Binary: 2 digit system, 1s and 0s</li>
      <li>- 8 bits of binary form a byte, and scale up to KB, MB, GB and so on</li>
      <li>ASCII: encoding language that represents text using numbers</li>
      <li>- Uses 7 bits to show 128 characters, from digits to letters, etc</li>
    </ul>

      What is Encryption?
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      Encryption is a crucial part of the internet, as it helps protect crucial data when transmitting. It revolves around using ciphers or other ways
      of encryption to keep sensitive files or texts safe when sent across the web.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Symmetric Encryption: uses 1 key to encrypt and decrypt data, making it faster [&] more efficient</li>
      <li>Asymmetric Encryption: uses 2 keys, private key [&] public key</li>
      <li>-Public key used to encrypt and send data, private key used to decrypt once recieved</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>
      HTTPS [&] Security
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to basically encrypt data that is sent through a client's search engine and the server.
      And the browser does a TLS handshake with the server when the client enters a website, which involves using encryption keys to verify their identity.
